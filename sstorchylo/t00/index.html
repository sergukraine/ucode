<h2 id="anchor">What makes a superhero?</h2>
<p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a 
    normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more 
    exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power 
    to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
    For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective 
    story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad 
    guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being 
    couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

Batman
<br>
<p>
    Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist,
    and owner of Wayne Enterprises. Batman originated from an incident in Bruce's childhood; 
    after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore 
    vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce trains himself 
    physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.
